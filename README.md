## **Objective**
To provide actionable insights for AtliQ Hardware by addressing challenges in financial performance, sales optimization, and supply chain efficiency through an interactive Power BI dashboard. This project highlights how data-driven decision-making can transform a growing business's operations and profitability.


## **Business Context**
AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in the manufacturing and distribution of computer hardware and peripherals, faced challenges due to outdated Excel-based analytics. These challenges led to inefficiencies, including significant losses. To address this, the **Business Insights 360** project was initiated, leveraging Power BI to create a comprehensive, cross-functional dashboard with insights into:
- Finance
- Sales
- Marketing
- Supply Chain
- Executive Decision-Making



## **Key Business Questions Answered**
1. What are the key drivers of financial performance across regions and products?
2. Which customers and products are contributing most to revenue and profitability?
3. How can sales strategies be optimized to enhance performance?
4. How accurate are the companyâ€™s demand forecasts, and where are the risks?
5. What high-level KPIs are needed for executive decision-making?



## **Key Insights**
- **Finance**: The Profit & Loss statement revealed a -13.98% drop in Net Profit %, driven by increased operational expenses in LATAM.
- **Sales**: Notebooks were the highest revenue-generating segment, while Networking had the lowest Gross Margin %.
- **Marketing**: APAC achieved the highest ROI, while LATAM campaigns require reevaluation due to low profitability.
- **Supply Chain**: Forecast Accuracy stood at 81.17%, with LATAM facing significant Out-of-Stock (OOS) issues.
- **Executive Summary**: The dashboard consolidates KPIs such as revenue contributions, market share trends, and top-performing customers/products.
